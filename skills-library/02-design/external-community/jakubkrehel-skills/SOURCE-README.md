## Install

### As a Claude Code plugin

Installs every skill in this repository together and updates in place. Run these inside Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add jakubkrehel/skills
/plugin install interfaces@interfaces
```

### With the skills CLI

Works in Claude Code, Codex and other agents. You can choose which skills to install or install all of them. `better-interface` coordinates the six domain skills and `interface-review` builds on `better-interface`, so install the complete collection when you want holistic or change-scoped reviews.

```bash
npx skills add jakubkrehel/skills
```

```bash
npx skills add jakubkrehel/skills --skill '*'
```

## Use

Two skills are invoked by name. Use `better-interface` to review a screen, flow or feature, and `interface-review` to review what you changed: your uncommitted work, the current branch or a pull request.

The default review mode is `full`. Pass `quick` for a shorter review. For `better-interface`, add the screen, flow or feature after the mode. For `interface-review`, add the target after the mode; leave it off and it detects the branch or your uncommitted changes.

In Claude Code, as a plugin. Plugin skills are namespaced, so every skill is prefixed with `interfaces:`.

```text
/interfaces:better-interface
/interfaces:better-interface quick
/interfaces:better-interface full checkout flow
/interfaces:interface-review
/interfaces:interface-review quick pr 482
```

In Claude Code, installed with the skills CLI:

```text
/better-interface
/better-interface quick
/better-interface full checkout flow
/interface-review
/interface-review quick pr 482
```

In Codex:

```text
$better-interface
$better-interface quick
$better-interface full checkout flow
$interface-review
$interface-review quick pr 482
```

The prefix only affects skills you invoke by name. The six domain skills are picked up automatically from context either way.
